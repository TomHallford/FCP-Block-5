Enter the folder containing FCP_assignment.py using git bash

The Flags for the python file are as follows:
=====task 1=====
-ising_model
-test_ising
-external
-alpha
=====task 2=====
-defuant
-test_defuant
-threshold
-beta
-n_count
-time_step
=====task 3=====
-network
-test_network
=====task 5=====
-use_network

The explination for each task function is as follows:
=====task 1=====

=====task 2=====

=====task 3=====
Using the network flag followed by an integer will create a random network with that many nodes, the network will then be displayed and the terminal will output the mean degree, average pathl ength and the mean clustering co-efficient.
Using the test network flag will run tests included in the code to verify the mean degree, average path length and mean clustering co-efficient are calculated correctly.
=====task 5=====
Use this flag followed by an integer after the main ising flag to run the ising model using a network. This will create a random network with a number of nodes equal to the integer put in, an animation will then play showing the ising model acting on the network.
